# A contract that can be used to offset transactions of other addresses

If you are curious about the dapp to interact with this contract [you have a repo here](https://github.com/lazaralex98/contract-offsetter-ui). Also, here is [a link to the ContractOffseter polygonscan here](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x4F828CeDAfcBa0cDd2d9Ace14caFfb0b1FaF9199).

In this README I will describe the `ContractOffsetter`, and NOT the `ContractOffsetterPOC`. For a [description of the POC itself go here](https://www.alexlazar.dev/posts/contract-offsetter-poc) (or [here](https://github.com/lazaralex98/alexlazar.dev/blob/main/_posts/contract-offsetter-poc.md)) and for [a description of the dapp go here](https://github.com/lazaralex98/contract-offsetter-ui/blob/main/README.md).
